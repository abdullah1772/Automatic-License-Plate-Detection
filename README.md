ðŸš— Exciting News! Introducing our latest project: Number Plate Detection with YOLOv8! ðŸš€
Ultralytics YOLOv8 is the state-of-the-art in real-time object detection, and it's at the heart of my new project. With its lightning-fast speed and exceptional accuracy, YOLOv8 allows to identify license plates on vehicles in parking lots and on busy highways with unparalleled precision.

Use Cases:
âœ… Road traffic monitoring for identifying traffic rule violations.
âœ… Security access control for tracking vehicles entering and exiting premises.
âœ… Parking lot management for recording parked vehicles' license plates.
âœ… Versatile applications including toll collection and law enforcement.

Future Direction:
Add OCR for extracting info from number plate.
Add object tracking for detecting and registering violations.
